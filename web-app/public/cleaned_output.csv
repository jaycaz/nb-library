Norton & Company,2010,Biography & Autobiography,352,2.10,,"A New York Times bestseller—the outrageous exploits of one of this century's greatest scientific minds and a legendary American original. Richard Feynman, winner of the Nobel Prize in physics, thrived on outrageous adventures. Here he recounts in his inimitable voice his experience trading ideas on atomic physics with Einstein and Bohr and ideas on gambling with Nick the Greek; cracking the uncrackable safes guarding the most deeply held nuclear secrets; accompanying a ballet on his bongo drums; painting a naked female toreador. In short, here is Feynman's life in all its eccentric—a combustible mixture of high intelligence, unlimited curiosity, and raging chutzpah.",7papZR4oVssC,,Cover image available via Google Books

Using the underlying theme of projective and injective modules, the author touches upon various aspects of commutative and noncommutative ring theory. In particular, a number of major results are highlighted and proved. Part I, 'Projective Modules', begins with basic module theory and then proceeds to surveying various special classes of rings (Wedderbum, Artinian and Noetherian rings, hereditary rings, Dedekind domains, etc.). This part concludes with an introduction and discussion of the concepts of the projective dimension.Part II, 'Polynomial Rings', studies these rings in a mildly noncommutative setting. Some of the results proved include the Hilbert Syzygy Theorem (in the commutative case) and the Hilbert Nullstellensatz (for almost commutative rings). Part III, 'Injective Modules', includes, in particular, various notions of the ring of quotients, the Goldie Theorems, and the characterization of the injective modules over Noetherian rings. The book contains numerous exercises and a list of suggested additional reading. It is suitable for graduate students and researchers interested in ring theory.",OKvQDgAAQBAJ,,Cover image available via Google Books

Intended for developers who are already familiar with the Apex language, and experienced Java and C# developers who are moving to Apex, this book starts where the Salesforce Apex documentation leaves off. Instead of trying to cover all of the features of the platform, Advanced Apex programming focuses entirely on the Apex language and core design patterns. You'll learn how to truly think in Apex - to embrace limits and bulk patterns. You'll see how to develop architectures for efficient and reliable trigger handling, and for asynchronous operations. You'll discover that best practices differ radically depending on whether you are building software for a specific organization or for a managed package. And you'll find approaches for incorporating testing and diagnostic code that can dramatically improve the reliability and deployment of Apex software, and reduce your lifecycle and support costs.

Do you need applications with a REST-based interface (so they can interact with other RESTful applications with almost no effort on your part)? All built-in. With this book, you'll learn how to use ActiveRecord to connect business objects and database tables. No more painful object-relational mapping. Just create your business objects and let Rails do the rest. Need to create and modify your schema? Migrations make it painless (and they're versioned, so you can roll changes backward and forward). You'll learn how to use the Action Pack framework to route incoming requests and render pages using easy-to-write templates and components. See how to exploit the Rails service frameworks to send emails, implement web services, and create dynamic, user-centric web-pages using built-in Javascript and Ajax support.

This work was directly related to Turing's leading role in breaking the German Enigma ciphers during World War II, a scientific triumph that was critical to Allied victory in the Atlantic. Despite his wartime service, Turing was eventually arrested, stripped of his security clearance, and forced to undergo a humiliating treatment program-- all for trying to live honestly in a society that defined homosexuality as a crime.

This book explores image processing from several perspectives: the creative, the theoretical (mainly mathematical), and the programmatical. It explains the basic principles of image processing, drawing on key concepts and techniques from mathematics, psychology of perception, computer science, and art, and introduces computer programming as a way to get more control over image processing operations. It does so without requiring college-level mathematics or prior programming experience. The content is supported by PixelMath, a freely available software program that helps the reader understand images as both visual and mathematical objects.The first part of the book covers such topics as digital image representation, sampling, brightness and contrast, color models, geometric transformations, synthesizing images, stereograms, photomosaics, and fractals. The second part of the book introduces computer programming using an open-source version of the easy-to-learn Python language. It covers the basics of image analysis and pattern recognition, including edge detection, convolution, thresholding, contour representation, and K-nearest-neighbor classification. A chapter on computational photography explores such subjects as high-dynamic-range imaging, autofocusing, and methods for automatically inpainting to fill gaps or remove unwanted objects in a scene. Applications described include the design and implementation of an image-based game.The PixelMath software provides a “transparent” view of digital images by allowing the user to view the RGB values of pixels by zooming in on an image.

To be sure, administrators installing and configuring Apache still need a sure-fire way to secure it--whether it's running a huge e-commerce operation, corporate intranet, or just a small hobby site. Our new guide, Apache Security, gives administrators and webmasters just what they crave--a comprehensive security source for Apache. Successfully combining Apache administration and web security topics, Apache Security speaks to nearly everyone in the field. What's more, it offers a concise introduction to the theory of securing Apache, as well as a broad perspective on server security in general. But this book isn't just about theory. The real strength of Apache Security lies in its wealth of interesting and practical advice, with many real-life examples and solutions. Administrators and programmers will learn how to: install and configure Apache prevent denial of service (DoS) and other attacks securely share servers control logging and monitoring secure custom-written web applications conduct a web security assessment use mod_security and other security-related modules And that's just the tip of the iceberg, as mainstream Apache users will also gain valuable information on PHP and SSL/ TLS.

Contrary to the hopes of feminists, many women have responded to religious nationalist appeals; contrary to the hopes of religious nationalists, they have also asserted their gender, class, caste, and religious identities; contrary to the hopes of nation states, they have often challenged state policies and practices. Through a comparative South Asia perspective, Appropriating Gender explores the varied meanings and expressions of gender identity through time, by location, and according to political context.  The first work to focus on women's agency and activism within the South Asian context, Appropriating Gender is an outstanding contribution to the field of gender studies.",3XhOG9BNd-EC,,Cover image available via Google Books

On a rocky patch of the sun-drenched Italian coastline, a young innkeeper, deep in daydreams, looks out over the waters of the Ligurian Sea and spies an apparition: a tall, thin woman, a vision in white, approaching him on a boat. She is an American starlet, he soon learns, and she is dying.And the story begins again today, half a world away, when an elderly Italian man shows up on a movie studio's back lot—searching for the mysterious woman he last saw at his hotel decades earlier.What unfolds is a dazzling roller coaster of a novel, spanning fifty years and nearly as many lives. From the lavish set of Cleopatra to the shabby revelry of the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, Walter introduces us to the tangled lives of a dozen unforgettable characters: the starstruck Italian innkeeper and his long-lost love; the heroically preserved producer who once brought them together and his idealistic young assistant; the army veteran turned fledgling novelist and the rakish Richard Burton himself, whose appetites set the whole story in motion—along with the husbands and wives, lovers and dreamers, superstars and losers, who populate their world in the decades that follow.

Muir Gray",9780262298087,MIT Press,2011,Medical,416,2.10,,"How eliminating “risk illiteracy” among doctors and patients will lead to better health care decision making.Contrary to popular opinion, one of the main problems in providing uniformly excellent health care is not lack of money but lack of knowledge—on the part of both doctors and patients. The studies in this book show that many doctors and most patients do not understand the available medical evidence. Both patients and doctors are “risk illiterate”—frequently unable to tell the difference between actual risk and relative risk. Further, unwarranted disparity in treatment decisions is the rule rather than the exception in the United States and Europe. All of this contributes to much wasted spending in health care.The contributors to Better Doctors, Better Patients, Better Decisions investigate the roots of the problem, from the emphasis in medical research on technology and blockbuster drugs to the lack of education for both doctors and patients. They call for a new, more enlightened health care, with better medical education, journals that report study outcomes completely and transparently, and patients in control of their personal medical records, not afraid of statistics but able to use them to make informed decisions about their treatments.",67zFZSrS6c0C,,Cover image available via Google Books

But it is his other job that he calls ""the Work"": investigating cases of demonic possession and assisting in the exorcisms of humanity's most ancient--and most dangerous--foes. Now he discloses for the first time his investigation into incredible true crimes an inhuman evil that were never explained, solved, or understood except by Sarchie and his partner. Schooled in the rituals of exorcism, and an eyewitness to the reality of demonic possession, Ralph Sarchie has documented a riveting chronicle of the inexplicable that gives a new shape to the shadows in the dark.  In Beware the Night, he takes readers into the very hierarchy of a hell on earth to expose the grisly rituals of a Palo Mayombe priest; a young girl whose innocence is violated by an incubus; a home invaded by the malevolent spirit of a supposedly murdered ninteenth-century bride; the dark side of a couple who were literally, the neighbors from hell; and more. Ralph Sarchie's NYPD revelations are a powerful and disturbing documented link between the true-crime realities of life and the blood-chilling ice-grip of a supernatural terror.",t0mvKP22yTkC,,

A metaprogram is a program that generates or manipulates program code. Ever since generic programming was introduced to C++, programmers have discovered myriad ""template tricks"" for manipulating programs as they are compiled, effectively eliminating the barrier between program and metaprogram. While excitement among C++ experts about these capabilities has reached the community at large, their practical application remains out of reach for most programmers. This book explains what metaprogramming is and how it is best used. It provides the foundation you'll need to use the template metaprogramming effectively in your own work. This book is aimed at any programmer who is comfortable with idioms of the Standard Template Library (STL). C++ power-users will gain a new insight into their existing work and a new fluency in the domain of metaprogramming. Intermediate-level programmers who have learned a few advanced template techniques will see where these tricks fit in the big picture and will gain the conceptual foundation to use them with discipline. Programmers who have caught the scent of metaprogramming, but for whom it is still mysterious, will finally gain a clear understanding of how, when, and why it works.

Computer Graphics and Geometric Modeling,David Salomon,9781461215042,Springer Science & Business Media,2012,Computers,852,2.5,,"Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736-1813), one of the greatest mathematicians of the 18th century, made important contributions to the theory of numbers and to analytical and celestial mechanics. His most important work is Mecanique Analytique (1788), the textbook on which all subsequent work in this field is based. A contempo rary reader is surprised to find no diagrams or figures of any kind in this book on mechanics. This reflects one extreme approach to graphics, namely considering it unimportant or even detracting as a teaching tool and not using it. Today, of course, this approach is unthinkable. Graphics, especially computer graphics, is commonly used in texts, advertisements, and movies to illustrate concepts, to emphasize points being discussed, and to entertain. Our approach to graphics has been completely reversed since the days of La grange, and it seems that much of this change is due to the use of computers. Computer graphics today is a mature, successful, and growing field. Itis used by many people for many purposes and it is enjoyed by even more people. One criterion for the maturity of a field of study is its size. When a certain discipline becomes so big that no one person can keep all of it in their head, we say that that discipline has matured (or has come of age). This is what happened to computer graphics in the last decade or so.",OyDvBwAAQBAJ,,Cover image available via Google Books

We can already watch news presented by virtual newscasters and play first-person 3D graphically based games with other players distributed around the world. Computer graphics is driving the technology for VEs, but the need for real-time is in conflict with the quest for increasing realism. This book shows how a real-time graphics system can be built using a top down approach to enhance understanding. It begins with high-level descriptions of perceptual and lighting issues relating to VEs, but quickly becomes more practical, showing how ray tracing can be used to produce high-quality images. Relaxing the assumptions of ray tracing, chapter by chapter, produces a system for generating 3D images in real-time or, in other words, the rendering pipeline of a graphics system.The book is intended for undergraduates or postgraduates studying computer graphics or the visual aspects of VEs.

CVS Pocket Reference,Gregor N. Purdy,9780596005672,"""O'Reilly Media, Inc.""",2003,Computers,84,2.12,,"The beauty of open source is making code freely available. The curse is trying to organize the chaos that code development can evolve into. CVS, the Concurrent Version System, is an open source tool for managing and distributing source code. It allows multiple users dispersed over a wide geographic area to work on the same file at the same time, using a shared directory. Under CVS, multiple users can check out files from a directory tree, make changes, and then commit those changes back into the directory. CVS is a pivotal tool on many projects involving information or software, whether in-house or conducted over the Internet. The CVS Pocket Reference is a quick reference guide to help administrators and users set up and manage source code development. This small book delivers the core concepts of version control along with a complete command reference and guide to configuration and repository set up. The book includes:A version control primer that teaches the general concepts of version control and how it applies to CVS. Instructions on how to install and configure CVS for Unix®-like operating systems. Administrator and user sections, with complete listings of their respective commands and options for configuring and using CVS. Details on how to import files from RCS and SCCS directories into CVS.

MIMD computers are notoriously difficult to program. Data-Parallel Programming demonstrates that architecture-independent parallel programming is possible by describing in detail how programs written in a high-level SIMD programming language may be compiled and efficiently executed-on both shared-memory multiprocessors and distributed-memory multicomputers. The authors provide enough data so that the reader can decide the feasibility of architecture-independent programming in a data-parallel language. For each benchmark program they give the source code listing, absolute execution time on both a multiprocessor and a multicomputer, and a speedup relative to a sequential program. And they often present multiple solutions to the same problem, to better illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of these compilers. The language presented is Dataparallel C, a variant of the original C* language developed by Thinking Machines Corporation for its Connection Machine processor array. Separate chapters describe the compilation of Dataparallel C programs for execution on the Sequent multiprocessor and the Intel and nCUBE hypercubes, respectively.

Design for Ecological Democracy,Jr. Randolph T. Hester,9780262515009,MIT Press,2010,Architecture,524,2.5,,"Shows how to combine the forces of ecological science and participatory democracy to design urban landscapes that enable us to act as communities, are resilient rather than imperiled, and touch our hearts.Over the last fifty years, the process of community building has been lost in the process of city building. City and suburban design divides us from others in our communities, destroys natural habitats, and fails to provide a joyful context for our lives. In Design for Ecological Democracy, Randolph Hester proposes a remedy for our urban anomie. He outlines new principles for urban design that will allow us to forge connections with our fellow citizens and our natural environment. He demonstrates these principles with abundantly illustrated examples—drawn from forty years of design and planning practice—showing how we can design cities that are ecologically resilient, that enhance community, and that give us pleasure. Hester argues that it is only by combining the powerful forces of ecology and democracy that the needed revolution in design will take place. Democracy bestows freedom; ecology creates responsible freedom by explaining our interconnectedness with all creatures. Hester's new design principles are founded on three fundamental issues that integrate democracy and ecology: enabling form, resilient form, and impelling form. Urban design must enable us to be communities rather than zoning-segregated enclaves and to function as informed democracies. A simple bench at a centrally located post office, for example, provides an opportunity for connection and shared experience. Cities must be ecologically resilient rather than ecologically imperiled, adaptable to the surrounding ecology rather than dependent on technological fixes. Resilient form turns increased urban density, for example, into an advantage. And cities should impel us by joy rather than compel us by fear; good cities enrich us rather than limit us.

Leslie Kanes Weisman offers a new framework for understanding the spatial dimensions of gender and race as well as class. She traces the social and architectural histories of the skyscraper, maternity hospital, department store, shopping mall, nuclear family dream house, and public housing high rise. Her vivid prose is based on exhaustive research and documents how each setting, along with public parks and streets, embodies and transmits the privileges and penalties of social caste. In presenting feminist themes from a spatial perspective, Weisman raises many new and important questions. When do women feel unsafe in cities, and why? Why do so many homeless people prefer to sleep on the streets rather than in city-run shelters? Why does the current housing crisis pose a greater threat to women than to men? How would dwellings, communities, and public buildings look if they were designed to foster relationships of equality and environmental wholeness? And how can we begin to imagine such a radically different landscape? In exploring the answers, the author introduces us to the people, policies, architectural innovations, and ideologies working today to shape a future in which all people matter.

DOM Scripting,Jeremy Keith,9781430200628,Apress,2006,Computers,368,2.8,,"We know from the success of titles such as Web Standards Solutions, Cascading Style Sheets: Separating Content from Presentation, and The Web Designer's Reference that web designers are increasingly concerned with making sites that don't just look pretty, but are also built using current best practices. There are three main technologies married together to create usable, standards-compliant web designs: XHTML for data structure, Cascading Style Sheets for styling your data, and JavaScript for adding dynamic effects and manipulating structure on the fly using the Document Object Model. This book is about the latter of the three. DOM Scripting: Web Design with JavaScript and the Document Object Model gives you everything you need to start using JavaScript and the Document Object Model to enhance your web pages with client-side dynamic effects. Jeremy Keith starts off by giving you a basic crash course in JavaScript and the DOM, then moves on to provide you with several real-world examples built up from scratch, including dynamic image galleries and dynamic menus. Then, he shows you how to manipulate web page style using the CSS DOM, and create markup on the fly.",LBTQ83bAz6QC,,Cover image available via Google Books

Double Cross,Ben Macintyre,9781408819906,A&C Black,2012,History,417,2.2,,"D-Day, 6 June 1944, the turning point of the Second World War, was a victory of arms. But it was also a triumph for a different kind of operation: one of deceit, aimed at convincing the Nazis that Calais and Norway, not Normandy, were the targets of the 150,000-strong invasion force. The deception involved every branch of Allied wartime intelligence - the Bletchley Park code-breakers, MI5, MI6, SOE, Scientific Intelligence, the FBI and the French Resistance. But at its heart was the ’Double Cross System’, a team of double agents controlled by the secret Twenty Committee, so named because twenty in Roman numerals forms a double cross. The key D-Day spies were just five in number, and one of the oddest military units ever assembled: a bisexual Peruvian playgirl, a tiny Polish fighter pilot, a Serbian seducer, a wildly imaginative Spaniard with a diploma in chicken farming, and a hysterical Frenchwoman whose obsessive love for her pet dog very nearly wrecked the entire deception. Their enterprise was saved from catastrophe by a shadowy sixth spy whose heroic sacrifice is here revealed for the first time. Under the direction of an eccentric but brilliant intelligence officer in tartan trousers, working from a smoky lair in St James’s, these spies would weave a web of deception so intricate that it ensnared Hitler’s army and helped to carry thousands of troops across the Channel in safety. These double agents were, variously, brave, treacherous, fickle, greedy and inspired. They were not conventional warriors, but their masterpiece of deceit saved countless lives. Their codenames were Bronx, Brutus, Treasure, Tricycle and Garbo. This is their story.",zj_SKwfc_z8C,,Cover image available via Google Books

High school had been an unbearable experience and their small-town Idaho families had been torn apart by hard times. On the fringe of society, they had almost no social lives and little to look forward to. They spent every spare cent on their computers and every spare moment online. Nobody ever spoke of them, much less for them.But then they met Jon Katz, a roving journalist who suggested that, in the age of geek impresario Bill Gates, Jesse and Eric had marketable skills that could get them out of Idaho and pave the way to a better life. So they bravely set out to conquer Chicago—geek style.

This succinct book departs from other security literature by focusing exclusively on ways to secure Cisco routers, rather than the entire network. The rational is simple: If the router protecting a network is exposed to hackers, then so is the network behind it. Hardening Cisco Routers is a reference for protecting the protectors. Included are the following topics: The importance of router security and where routers fit into an overall security plan Different router configurations for various versions of Cisco?s IOS Standard ways to access a Cisco router and the security implications of each Password and privilege levels in Cisco routers Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) control Router warning banner use (as recommended by the FBI)  Unnecessary protocols and services commonly run on Cisco routers SNMP security Anti-spoofing Protocol security for RIP, OSPF, EIGRP, NTP, and BGP Logging violations Incident response Physical security Written by Thomas Akin, an experienced Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) and Certified Cisco Academic Instructor (CCAI), the book is well organized, emphasizing practicality and a hands-on approach. At the end of each chapter, Akin includes a Checklist that summarizes the hardening techniques discussed in the chapter. The Checklists help you double-check the configurations you have been instructed to make, and serve as quick references for future security procedures.

But you don't just want to see how patterns look in a book, you want to know how they look ""in the wild"". In their native environment. In other words, in real world applications. You also want to learn how patterns are used in the Java API, and how to exploit Java's built-in pattern support in your own code. You want to learn the real OO design principles and why everything your boss told you about inheritance might be wrong (and what to do instead).

Since then, Sun Microsystems has become a formidable presence in the industry, making its own rules and taking no prisoners, and is currently poised to reach the highest point of its ascendancy--the challenge of Microsoft's dominance over the future of computing.  The driving force behind this once fledgling company is a man who has been described as brash, unconventional, ambitious, forward-looking, and sometimes even his own worst enemy. Scott McNealy turned Sun into the multibillion-dollar success it is today--a developer of innovative software like Java that is revolutionizing the computing landscape.  High Noon is the inside story of Sun's rise to power, from its shaky start in Silicon Valley through its transformation under the aggressive and inspirational leadership of McNealy. Karen Southwick reveals the behind-the-scenes maneuverings of McNealy and Sun, with candid interviews from the key players and insights into the inner workings of the high-tech industry.

How to Build a Beowulf,Thomas Lawrence Sterling,9780262692182,MIT Press,1999,Computers,239,2.5,,"This how-to guide provides step-by-step instructions for building aBeowulf-type computer, including the physical elements that make up aclustered PC computing system, the software required (most of which isfreely available), and insights on how to organize the code to exploitparallelism. Supercomputing research--the goal of which is to make computers that are ever faster and more powerful--has been at the cutting edge of computer technology since the early 1960s. Until recently, research cost in the millions of dollars, and many of the companies that originally made supercomputers are now out of business.The early supercomputers used distributed computing and parallel processing to link processors together in a single machine, often called a mainframe. Exploiting the same technology, researchers are now using off-the-shelf PCs to produce computers with supercomputer performance. It is now possible to make a supercomputer for less than $40,000. Given this new affordability, a number of universities and research laboratories are experimenting with installing such Beowulf-type systems in their facilities.This how-to guide provides step-by-step instructions for building a Beowulf-type computer, including the physical elements that make up a clustered PC computing system, the software required (most of which is freely available), and insights on how to organize the code to exploit parallelism.

It chronicles the transformation of IBM into a computer company in a remarkably few years, discussing projects that ended in frustration as well as the more successful ones, and providing a sense of the atmosphere, the people, and the decision-making processes involved during the company's rapid technological transformation.IBM's Early Computers is a unique contribution to the modern history of computers. It focuses on engineering alternatives rather than business and general management considerations and reveals the significance of imaginative solutions to problems in design and technology, from initial experiments with electronics in digital machines to the threshold of the System 360 era. This fair and balanced account of IBM's role in shaping today's electronic revolution identifies the individuals (both inside and outside the company) whose pioneering work influenced developments at IBM.The book's fourteen chapters briefly survey the card machine era and then cover electronic calculation, the magnetic drum calculator, the Defense Calculator and other first-generation products, ferrite core memories, magnetic tape, and disk storage development, programming, transistors, ""Project Stretch"" (which involved disappointments but led to one of IBM's greatest successes) high-speed printers, research, and new-product-line considerations.Charles J. Bashe, Lyle R. Johnson, John H. Palmer, and Emerson W Pugh are senior members of the staff at IBM's Thomas J.

Specifically designed to be a practical tool for the user of computer graphics systems, it provides a library of correct algorithms and offers an original set of methodological procedures that will enable a user to solve problems from the particular to the most general level.The book examines the three major classes of image synthesis - curve generation, zone filling, and geometric processing - providing the fundamentals for any image synthesis system. It presents a systematic review of the algorithms needed for each class of problem, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each; the algorithms have been written in a descriptive language, allowing the user to program them in whatever language he or she desires.Despite the wide variety of algorithms presented, Hegron draws them together into two unifying procedures, which he discusses in great detail: curve generation based on Bresenham's methods, and contour following. Because these two techniques can be applied to such a diversity of problems, they provide the user with a systematic basis for a software package.Gerard Hegron is a research scientist in the National Institut of Research in Computer Science and Automatic Control (INRIA, France).",p3tuAAAAMAAJ,,Cover image available via Google Books

When he embarks on a journey with his grandfather, Nyles High Eagle, he learns more and more about his Lakota heritage—in particular, the story of Crazy Horse, one of the most important figures in Lakota and American history. Drawing references and inspiration from the oral stories of the Lakota tradition, celebrated author Joseph Marshall III juxtaposes the contemporary story of Jimmy with an insider’s perspective on the life of Tasunke Witko, better known as Crazy Horse (c. 1840–1877). The book follows the heroic deeds of the Lakota leader who took up arms against the US federal government to fight against encroachments on the territories and way of life of the Lakota people, including leading a war party to victory at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Along with Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse was the last of the Lakota to surrender his people to the US army.

Incentives and Choice in Health Care,"Frank A. Sloan,Hirschel Kasper",9780262195775,MIT Press,2008,Business & Economics,419,2.10,,"A vast body of empirical evidence has accumulated demonstrating that incentives affect health care choices made by both consumers and suppliers of health care services. Decisions in health care are affected by many types of incentives, such as the rate of return pharmaceutical manufacturers expect on their investments in research and development, or disincentives, such as increases in copayments patients must make when they visit physicians or are admitted to hospitals.In this volume, leading scholars in health economics review these new and important results and describe their own recent research assessing the role of incentives in health care markets and decisions people make that affect their personal health. The contexts include demand decisions -- choices made by individuals about health care services they consume and the health insurance policies they purchase -- and supply decisions made by medical students, practicing physicians, hospitals, and pharmaceutical manufacturers. Researchers and students of health economics and policy makers will find this book a valuable resource, both for learning economic concepts, particularly as they apply to health care, and for reading up-to-date summaries of the empirical evidence. General readers will find the book's chapters accessible, interesting, and useful for gaining an understanding of the likely effects of alternative health care policies.ContributorsHenry J.

Good web site consultants know that you can't just jump in and start writing HTML, the same way you can't build a house by just pouring a foundation and putting up some walls. You need to know who will be using the site, and what they'll be using it for. You need some idea of what you'd like to draw their attention to during their visit. Overall, you need a strong, cohesive vision for the site that makes it both distinctive and usable. Information Architecture for the World Wide Webis about applying the principles of architecture and library science to web site design. Each web site is like a public building, available for tourists and regulars alike to breeze through at their leisure. The job of the architect is to set up the framework for the site to make it comfortable and inviting for people to visit, relax in, and perhaps even return to someday. Most books on web development concentrate either on the aesthetics or the mechanics of the site. This book is about the framework that holds the two together. With this book, you learn how to design web sites and intranets that support growth, management, and ease of use.

The book also discusses how to use the free integrated development environment, ebe, designed by the author specifically to meet the needs of assembly language programmers.Ebe is a C++ program which uses the Qt library to implement a GUI environment consisting of a source window, a data window, a register window, a floating point register window, a backtrace window, a console window, a terminal window, a project window and a pair of teaching tools called the ""Toy Box"" and the ""Bit Bucket"".The source window includes a full-featured text editor with convenient controls for assembling, linking and debugging a program. The project facility allows a program to be built from C source code files and assembly source files. Assembly is performed automatically using the yasm assembler and linking is performed with ld or gcc. Debugging operates by transparently sending commands into the gdb debugger while automatically displaying registers and variables after each debugging step.The Toy Box allows the use to enter variable definitions and expressions in either C++ or Fortran and it builds a program to evaluate the expressions. Then the user can inspect the format of each expression.The Bit Bucket allows the user to explore how the computer stores and manipulates integers and floating point numbers.Additional information about ebe can be found at http://www.rayseyfarth.com. The book is intended as a first assembly language book for programmers experienced in high level programming in a language like C or C++.The assembly programming is performed using the yasm assembler automatically from the ebe IDE under the Linux operating system.The book primarily teaches how to write assembly code compatible with C programs.

Introduction to Atmospheric Chemistry,Daniel J. Jacob,9780691001852,Princeton University Press,1999,Nature,266,2.10,,"Atmospheric chemistry is one of the fastest growing fields in the earth sciences. Until now, however, there has been no book designed to help students capture the essence of the subject in a brief course of study. Daniel Jacob, a leading researcher and teacher in the field, addresses that problem by presenting the first textbook on atmospheric chemistry for a one-semester course. Based on the approach he developed in his class at Harvard, Jacob introduces students in clear and concise chapters to the fundamentals as well as the latest ideas and findings in the field. Jacob's aim is to show students how to use basic principles of physics and chemistry to describe a complex system such as the atmosphere. He also seeks to give students an overview of the current state of research and the work that led to this point. Jacob begins with atmospheric structure, design of simple models, atmospheric transport, and the continuity equation, and continues with geochemical cycles, the greenhouse effect, aerosols, stratospheric ozone, the oxidizing power of the atmosphere, smog, and acid rain. Each chapter concludes with a problem set based on recent scientific literature. This is a novel approach to problem-set writing, and one that successfully introduces students to the prevailing issues. This is a major contribution to a growing area of study and will be welcomed enthusiastically by students and teachers alike.",14whM9fEOzsC,,Cover image available via Google Books

They are extremely important as basic equations in many areas of mathematical physics, and they have received renewed attention because of progress in their solution by machines. This volume undertakes a definition of the field, indicating advances that have been made up through 1960. The author's position is that while the advent of machines has resulted in much new knowledge, one should not disregard analytical methods, since the solution of nonlinear equations possesses singularities which only the analytical method (as based upon the work of Poincare, Liapounoff, Painleve and Goursatl can discover. After a general survey of the problem presented by nonlinear equations, the author discusses the differential equation of the first order, following this by chapters on the Riccati equation (as a bridge between linear and nonlinear equations) and existence theorems, with special reference to Cauchy's method. Second order equations are introduced via Volterra's problem and the problem of pursuit, and succeeding chapters cover elliptic integrals and functions and theta functions; differential equations of the second order; and second order differential equations of the polynomial class, with special reference to Painleve transcendents. The technique of continuous analytical continuation is shown, while phenomena of the phase plane are studied as an introduction to nonlinear mechanics. Nonlinear 111echanics is then discussed, with various classical equations like Van der Pol's equations, Emden's equation, and the Duffing problem. The remaining chapters are concerned with nonlinear integral equations, problems from the calculus of variations, and numerical integration of nonlinear equations. Throughout the book the results of distinguished analysis of the past and modern machine computations are both taken into account.

Snort is the most widely used open-source security system for small to medium businesses, with over 100,000 installations worldwide. Author is the information security officer at a bank in Chicago, where he architected a Snort-based intrusion detection system. Book covers basic maintenance and deployment, as well as the majority of snort.org's common help requests. With over 100,000 installations, the Snort open-source network intrusion detection system is combined with other free tools to deliver IDS defense to medium-to-small-sized companies, changing the tradition of intrusion detection being affordable only for large companies with large budgets. Until now, Snort users had to rely on the official guide available on snort.org. That guide is aimed at relatively experienced Snort administrators and covers thousands of rules and known exploits. The lack of usable information made using Snort a frustrating experience. The average Snort user needs to learn how to actually get their system up and running. Snort Intrusion Detection provides readers with practical guidance on how to put Snort to work.

For more than three decades as a physician and medical researcher, he has studied the experience of low back pain in people who are otherwise healthy. Hadler terms the low back pain that everyone suffers at one time or another ""regional back pain."" In this book, he addresses the history and treatment of the ailment with the healthy skepticism that has become his trademark, taking the ""Hadlerian"" approach to backaches and the backache treatment industry in order to separate the helpful from the hype.    Basing his critique on an analysis of the most current medical literature as well as his clinical experience, Hadler argues that regional back pain is overly medicalized by doctors, surgeons, and alternative therapists who purvey various treatment regimens. Furthermore, the design of workers' compensation, disability insurance, and other ""health"" schemes actually thwarts getting well. For the past half century, says Hadler, back pain and back pain-related disability have exacted a huge toll, in terms of pain, suffering, and financial cost. Stabbed in the Back addresses this issue at multiple levels: as a human predicament, a profound social problem, a medical question, and a vexing public-policy challenge.

This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole—a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code.Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables.When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including:SyntaxObjectsFunctionsInheritanceArraysRegular expressionsMethodsStyleBeautiful featuresThe real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book.With JavaScript: The Good Parts, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast.

In 1965 the city burst into flames during one of the worst race riots in the nation's history. How the city came to such a pass—embodying both the best and worst of what urban America offered black migrants from the South—is the story told for the first time in this history of modern black Los Angeles. A clear-eyed and compelling look at black struggles for equality in L.A.'s neighborhoods, schools, and workplaces from the Great Depression to our day, L.A. City Limits critically refocuses the ongoing debate about the origins of America's racial and urban crisis. Challenging previous analysts' near-exclusive focus on northern ""rust-belt"" cities devastated by de-industrialization, Josh Sides asserts that the cities to which black southerners migrated profoundly affected how they fared. He shows how L.A.'s diverse racial composition, dispersive geography, and dynamic postwar economy often created opportunities—and limits—quite different from those encountered by blacks in the urban North.",De1uGmvpw30C,,Cover image available via Google Books

The incorporated revisions grew out of the authors' decade and more of classroom experience. Revisions were also made in accordance with recommendations proposed by instructors who have used the Learn Japanese series. The new edition, which reflects recent trends in language teaching, continues to emphasize an integrated approach in which speaking, hearing, reading, and writing Japanese all contribute to the language learning process.- The most significant improvement is the addition of Culture Notes to help clarify the sociolinguistic context in which the language is used. Since Japanese modes of communication are highly situational, the student of Japanese needs to be made aware of the different contexts in which speakers interact. Culture Notes, used in conjunction with Grammar Notes, Dialogs, and Useful Expressions, show how an understanding of cultural values and human relationships can enhance the student's mastery of language skills.- A new approach to language learning is used throughout the revised edition. The new sociolinguistic approach (which encourages the ""generation of discourse"") is integrated with the original pattern approach (which encourages the ""generation of sentences"").- Many components of the first edition, such as Sentence Patterns, Grammar Notes, and Reviews, have been revised and/or rearranged. The result is a clearer, more natural, and more functional presentation of the Japanese language.The four volumes of Learn Japanese: New College Text were prepared by the Asian Division of the University of Maryland University College and are published by the University of Hawaii Press.",mL3lzAEACAAJ,,

We are using life on the screen to engage in new ways of thinking about evolution, relationships, politics, sex, and the self. Life on the Screen traces a set of boundary negotiations, telling the story of the changing impact of the computer on our psychological lives and our evolving ideas about minds, bodies, and machines. What is emerging, Turkle says, is a new sense of identity—as decentered and multiple. She describes trends in computer design, in artificial intelligence, and in people’s experiences of virtual environments that confirm a dramatic shift in our notions of self, other, machine, and world.

With a focus on the development of mathematical intuition, the book emphasizes the need to understand both the applications of a particular technique and the mathematical ideas underlying the technique. The book introduces each new concept in the context of an explicit numerical example, which allows the abstract concepts to grow organically out of the necessity to solve specific problems. The intuitive discussions are consistently followed by rigorous statements of results and proofs. Linear Algebra: Ideas and Applications, Fourth Edition also features:  Two new and independent sections on the rapidly developing subject of wavelets A thoroughly updated section on electrical circuit theory Illuminating applications of linear algebra with self-study questions for additional study End-of-chapter summaries and sections with true-false questions to aid readers with further comprehension of the presented material Numerous computer exercises throughout using MATLAB® code  Linear Algebra: Ideas and Applications, Fourth Edition is an excellent undergraduate-level textbook for one or two semester courses for students majoring in mathematics, science, computer science, and engineering.

In this environment, an understanding of a system's limitations acquires added importance. Without such knowledge, one might unknowingly attempt to design an impossible system. Thus, a thorough investigation of all of a system's properties is essential. In fact, many design procedures have evolved from such investigations. For use at the senior-graduate level in courses on linear systems and multivariable system design, this highly successful text is devoted to this study and the design procedures developed thereof. It is not a control text, per se--since it does not cover performance criteria, physical constraints, cost, optimization, and sensitivity problems. Chen develops major results and design procedures using simple and efficient methods. Thus, the presentation is not exhaustive; only those concepts which are essential in the development are introduced.

Wells to Star Trek, audiences have been captivated by the notions of time travel, time warps, space warps, and wornholes. But science fiction is not the only realm where these concepts thrive. An active group of general relativists and quantum field theorists has produced a considerable body of serious (thought admittedly speculative) mathematical and physical analyses of the wormhole system. Now, with this fascinating book, readers can explore in depth the science behind the science fiction. Drawing on pivotal work by Einstein, Wheeler, Morris, Thorne, Hawking, and others, Matt Visser charts the development and current state of Lorentzian wormhole physics. Dr. Visser shows that by pushing established physical theories to their limits, it is possible to deduce the physical properties of such exotica as wormholes and time travel. The physical framework he uses is derived from one of the major research frontiers of modern theoretical physics: quantum gravity-the intersection of classical Einstein gravity and quantum field theory. Physicists, students of general relativity, cosmology, quantum physics, or any interested reader with a background in physics wil find this a provocative introduction to an exciting and active topic of ongoing research.",TYBrQgAACAAJ,,

Itching to build a cockroach-controlled robot, a portable satellite radio or your very own backyard monorail? Hankering to hack a game boy or your circadian rhythms? Rather read about people who fashion laptop bags from recycled wetsuits and build shopping cart go-karts? Make is required reading.  Now, following on the heels of Make's wildly popular inaugural issues, O'Reilly offers Makers, a beautiful hardbound book celebrating creativity, resourcefulness and the DIY spirit. Author Bob Parks profiles 100 people and their homebrew projects-people who make ingenious things in their backyards, basements and garages with a lot of imagination and a little applied skill.  Makers features technologies old and new used in service of the serious and the amusing, the practical and the outrageous. The makers profiled are driven by a combination of curiosity, passion and plain old stick-to-itiveness to create the unique and astonishing. Most are simply hobbyists who'll never gain notoriety for their work, but that's not what motivates them to tinker. The collection explores both the projects and the characters behind them, and includes full-color photographs and instructions to inspire weekend hackers.  Parks is just the man to track the quirky and outlandish in their natural maker habitats. A well-known journalist and author who covers the personalities behind the latest technologies, Parks' articles on innovations of all kinds have appeared in Wired, Outside, Business 2.0 and Make. He has contributed essays to ""All Things Considered"" on public radio and discussed trends in technology devices with Regis Philbin and Russ Mitchell on television.

Computer scientists have identified many techniques that a wide range of programs need, such as: Fuzzy pattern matching for text (identify misspellings!) Finding correlations in data Game-playing algorithms Predicting phenomena such as Web traffic Polynomial and spline fitting  Using algorithms explained in this book, you too can carry out traditional programming tasks in a high-powered, efficient, easy-to-maintain manner with Perl. This book assumes a basic understanding of Perl syntax and functions, but not necessarily any background in computer science. The authors explain in a readable fashion the reasons for using various classic programming techniques, the kind of applications that use them, and -- most important -- how to code these algorithms in Perl. If you are an amateur programmer, this book will fill you in on the essential algorithms you need to solve problems like an expert. If you have already learned algorithms in other languages, you will be surprised at how much different (and often easier) it is to implement them in Perl. And yes, the book even has the obligatory fractal display program. There have been dozens of books on programming algorithms, some of them excellent, but never before has there been one that uses Perl.

Although a lot can be said for the robustness, clean organization, and stability of the BSD operating systems, security is one of the main reasons system administrators use these two platforms. There are plenty of books to help you get a FreeBSD or OpenBSD system off the ground, and all of them touch on security to some extent, usually dedicating a chapter to the subject. But, as security is commonly named as the key concern for today's system administrators, a single chapter on the subject can't provide the depth of information you need to keep your systems secure. FreeBSD and OpenBSD are rife with security ""building blocks"" that you can put to use, and Mastering FreeBSD and OpenBSD Security shows you how. Both operating systems have kernel options and filesystem features that go well beyond traditional Unix permissions and controls. This power and flexibility is valuable, but the colossal range of possibilities need to be tackled one step at a time. This book walks you through the installation of a hardened operating system, the installation and configuration of critical services, and ongoing maintenance of your FreeBSD and OpenBSD systems. Using an application-specific approach that builds on your existing knowledge, the book provides sound technical information on FreeBSD and Open-BSD security with plenty of real-world examples to help you configure and deploy a secure system.

Also, it includes an entirely new section on Probability and plenty of new material on tensors and integral transforms.  Some praise for the previous edition: ""The book has many strengths. For example: Each chapter starts with a preamble that puts the chapters in context. Often, the author uses physical examples to motivate definitions, illustrate relationships, or culminate the development of particular mathematical strands. The use of Maxwell's equations to cap the presentation of vector calculus, a discussion that includes some tidbits about what led Maxwell to the displacement current, is a particularly enjoyable example.

Which processor will I use? How should I choose it?' Given the task of selecting an architecture or design approach, both engineers and managers require a knowledge of the whole system and an explanation of the design tradeoffs and their effects. This is information that rarely appears in data sheets or user manuals. This book fills that knowledge gap.Section 1 provides a primer and history of the three basic microprocessor architectures. Section 2 describes the ways in which the architectures react with the system. Section 3 looks at some more commercial aspects such as semiconductor technology, the design cycle, and selection criteria. The appendices provide benchmarking data and binary compatibility standards. Since the first edition of this book was published, much has happened within the industry. The Power PC architecture has appeared and RISC has become a more significant challenger to CISC. The book now includes new material on Power PC, and a complete chapter devoted to understanding the RISC challenge. The examples used in the text have been based on Motorola microprocessor families, but the system considerations are also applicable to other processors. For this reason comparisons to other designs have been included, and an overview of other processors including the Intel 80x86 and Pentium, DEC Alpha, SUN Sparc, and MIPS range has been given. Steve Heath has been involved in the design and development of microprocessor based systems since 1982. These designs have included VMEbus systems, microcontrollers, IBM PCs, Apple Macintoshes, and both CISC and RISC based multiprocessor systems, while using operating systems as varied as MS-DOS, UNIX, Macintosh OS and real time kernels.

Mind Children, written by an internationally renowned roboticist, offers a comparable experience-a mind-boggling glimpse of a world we may soon share with our artificial progeny. Filled with fresh ideas and insights, this book is one of the most engaging and controversial visions of the future ever written by a serious scholar.  Hans Moravec convincingly argues that we are approaching a watershed in the history of life-a time when the boundaries between biological and postbiological intelligence will begin to dissolve. Within forty years, Moravec believes, we will achieve human equivalence in our machines, not only in their capacity to reason but also in their ability to perceive, interact with, and change their complex environment. The critical factor is mobility. A computer rooted to one place is doomed to static iterations, whereas a machine on the prowl, like a mobile organism, must evolve a richer fund of knowledge about an ever-changing world upon which to base its actions.  In order to achieve anything near human equivalence, robots will need, at the least, the capacity to perform ten trillion calculations per second. Given the trillion-fold increase in computational power since the end of the nineteenth century, and the promise of exotic technologies far surpassing the now-familiar lasers and even superconductors, Moravec concludes that our hardware will have no trouble meeting this forty-year timetable.  But human equivalence is just the beginning, not an upper bound.

Mindstorms,Seymour A. Papert,9780465046744,Basic Books,1993,Education,252,2.7,,"The book that started the computer revolution in schoolsComputers have completely changed the way we teach children. We have Mindstorms to thank for that. In this book, pioneering computer scientist Seymour Papert uses the invention of LOGO, the first child-friendly programming language, to make the case for the value of teaching children with computers. Papert argues that children are more than capable of mastering computers, and that teaching computational processes like de-bugging in the classroom can change the way we learn everything else. He also shows that schools saturated with technology can actually improve socialization and interaction among students and between students and teachers.Technology changes every day, but the basic ways that computers can help us learn remain. For thousands of teachers and parents who have sought creative ways to help children learn with computers, Mindstorms is their bible.",Li2YswEACAAJ,,Cover image available via Google Books

As the pioneering text in the field and as the text still preferred today, Molecular Vibrations is the undeniable choice of anyone teaching or studying molecular spectroscopy at the graduate level. It is the only book of its kind in the area written by well-known scientists, and besides its value as a pedagogical classic, it is an essential reference for anyone engaged in research.The genius of the book is its rigorous, elegant treatment of the mathematics involved in detailed vibrational analyses of polyatomic molecules. The reader is led carefully and gradually through the main features of the theory and its methods: starting from a valuable introduction to the theory of molecular vibrations and the application of wave mechanics to this subject; leading into the mathematical methods devised by Professor Wilson and his students for handling the mathematical problems and for making use of symmetry and group theory; proceeding through vibrational selection rules and intensities, potential functions and methods of solving the secular determinant; and concluding with a sample vibrational analysis of the molecule of benzene. Sixteen appendices, comprising nearly one hundred pages, offer much extremely useful information that is more clearly understood outside the body of the text.Well-known for their distinguished contributions to the field, the authors — in addition to Professor Wilson of Harvard University — are J.

From batting averages and political polls to game shows and medical research, the real-world application of statistics continues to grow by leaps and bounds. How can we catch schools that cheat on standardized tests? How does Netflix know which movies you’ll like? What is causing the rising incidence of autism? As best-selling author Charles Wheelan shows us in Naked Statistics, the right data and a few well-chosen statistical tools can help us answer these questions and more. For those who slept through Stats 101, this book is a lifesaver. Wheelan strips away the arcane and technical details and focuses on the underlying intuition that drives statistical analysis. He clarifies key concepts such as inference, correlation, and regression analysis, reveals how biased or careless parties can manipulate or misrepresent data, and shows us how brilliant and creative researchers are exploiting the valuable data from natural experiments to tackle thorny questions. And in Wheelan’s trademark style, there’s not a dull page in sight. You’ll encounter clever Schlitz Beer marketers leveraging basic probability, an International Sausage Festival illuminating the tenets of the central limit theorem, and a head-scratching choice from the famous game show Let’s Make a Deal—and you’ll come away with insights each time.

While on a desperate flight to warn his family of the threat, Kaladin Stormblessed must come to grips with the fact that the newly kindled anger of the parshmen may be wholly justified.Nestled in the mountains high above the storms, in the tower city of Urithiru, Shallan Davar investigates the wonders of the ancient stronghold of the Knights Radiant and unearths dark secrets lurking in its depths. And Dalinar realizes that his holy mission to unite his homeland of Alethkar was too narrow in scope. Unless all the nations of Roshar can put aside Dalinar’s blood-soaked past and stand together—and unless Dalinar himself can confront that past—even the restoration of the Knights Radiant will not prevent the end of civilization.Other Tor books by Brandon SandersonThe CosmereThe Stormlight Archive● The Way of Kings● Words of Radiance● Edgedancer (novella)● Oathbringer● Dawnshard (novella)● Rhythm of WarThe Mistborn SagaThe Original Trilogy● Mistborn● The Well of Ascension● The Hero of AgesWax and Wayne● The Alloy of Law● Shadows of Self● The Bands of Mourning● The Lost MetalOther Cosmere novels● Elantris● Warbreaker● Tress of the Emerald Sea● Yumi and the Nightmare Painter● The Sunlit ManCollection● Arcanum Unbounded: The Cosmere CollectionThe Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians series● Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians● The Scrivener's Bone...",Le9nEQAAQBAJ,,Cover image available via Google Books

No less renowned for his virtuoso color cinematography and deft appropriation of widescreen and Technicolor, he earned an Academy Award in 1951 for his work on the musical An American in Paris.

In the process, he unveils a host of paradoxes underpinning our understanding of modern biology, contradictions he considers gatekeepers at the frontiers of knowledge. Though we tend to think of concepts in such mutually exclusive pairs as mind-matter, self-other, and nature-nurture, Wagner argues that these opposing ideas are not actually separate. Indeed, they are as inextricably connected as the two sides of a coin. Through a tour of modern biological marvels, Wagner illustrates how this paradoxical tension has a profound effect on the way we define the world around us. Paradoxical Life is thus not only a unique account of modern biology. It ultimately serves a radical--and optimistic--outlook for humans and the world we help create.",jJr38pU9qz4C,,Cover image available via Google Books

The rest of us are thrust into it: we are webmasters, hobbyists, or just the default ""technical people"" on staff who are expected to keep things running. After some stumbling around repeating the same steps over and over again (and occasionally paying the price when we forget one), we realize that we must automate these tasks, or suffer endless frustration. Thus enters Perl.The Perl programming language is ideal for writing quick yet powerful scripts that automate many administrative tasks. It's modular, it's powerful, and it's perfect for managing systems and services on many platforms.Perl for System Administration is designed for all levels of administrators--from hobbyists to card-carrying SAGE members--sysadmins on multi-platform sites. Written for several different platforms (Unix, Windows NT, and Mac OS), it's a guide to the pockets of administration where Perl can be most useful for sites large and small, including:  Filesystem management User administration with a dash of XML DNS and other network name services Database administration using DBI and ODBC Directory services and frameworks like LDAP and ADSI Using email for system administration Working with log files of all kinds  Each chapter concentrates on a single administrative area, discusses the possible pitfalls, and then shows how Perl comes to the rescue. Along the way we encounter interesting Perl features and tricks, with many extended examples and complete programs. The scripts included in the book can simply be used as written or with minimal adaptation. But it's likely that readers will also get a taste of what Perl can do, and start extending those scripts for tasks that we haven't dreamed of.Perl for System Adminstration doesn't attempt to teach the Perl language, but it is an excellent introduction to the power and flexibility of Perl, and it whets the appetite to learn more.

Web and applications programmers know that a dull web page can be quickly transformed into one that's interesting and lively with the use of well-planned graphics. And fortunately, you don't need the skills of a fulltime graphics programmer to use graphics effectively. From access counters and log report graphs to scientific plots and on-the-fly animated GIFs, graphics scripting is within the grasp of most web programmers. Using open source software, like Perl, you have the power to dynamically generate graphics based on user input and activity, easily manipulate graphics content, and optimize graphics for compression and quality. Geared toward Perl users and webmasters, Perl Graphics Programming focuses on open-source scripting programs that manipulate graphics files for use on the Web. The book demystifies the manipulation of graphics formats for newcomers to the Web with a practical, resource-like approach. With this book you'll learn to: Generate dynamic web graphics with charts, tables, and buttons Automate graphics tasks (thumbnails and borders) Create dynamics web documents (PDF, Postscript) Produce rich Internet experiences with Flash and SVG You'll begin with a tour of the most common web graphic file formats--PNG, JPEG, GIF, SWF, SVG, Postscript and PDF--then you'll explore the most powerful tools and Perl modules available for manipulating these graphics, such as GD, PerlMagick, and GIMP.

That is, besides game programming, 3D graphics, audio, high-performance clustering, cool websites, et cetera? Okay, so software testing is low on the list. And that's unfortunate, because good software testing can increase your productivity, improve your designs, raise your quality, ease your maintenance burdens, and help to satisfy your customers, coworkers, and managers.Perl has a strong history of automated tests. A very early release of Perl 1.0 included a comprehensive test suite, and it's only improved from there. Learning how Perl's test tools work and how to put them together to solve all sorts of previously intractable problems can make you a better programmer in general. Besides, it's easy to use the Perl tools described to handle all sorts of testing problems that you may encounter, even in other languages.Like all titles in O'Reilly's Developer's Notebook series, this ""all lab, no lecture"" book skips the boring prose and focuses instead on a series of exercises that speak to you instead of at you.

Practical Statistics for Field Biology,"Jim Fowler,Lou Cohen,Philip Jarvis",9781118685648,John Wiley & Sons,2013,Science,272,2.7,,"Practical Statistics for Field Biology, 2nd Edition Provides an excellent introductory text for students on the principles and methods of statistical analysis in the life sciences, helping them choose and analyse statistical tests for their own problems and present their findings. An understanding of statistical principles and methods is essential for any scientist but is particularly important for those in the life sciences. The field biologist faces very particular problems and challenges with statistics as ""real-life"" situations such as collecting insects with a sweep net or counting seagulls on a cliff face can hardly be expected to be as reliable or controllable as a laboratory-based experiment. Acknowledging the peculiarites of field-based data and its interpretation, this book provides a superb introduction to statistical analysis helping students relate to their particular and often diverse data with confidence and ease. To enhance the usefulness of this book, the new edition incorporates the more advanced method of multivariate analysis, introducing the nature of multivariate problems and describing the the techniques of principal components analysis, cluster analysis and discriminant analysis which are all applied to biological examples. An appendix detailing the statistical computing packages available has also been included. It will be extremely useful to undergraduates studying ecology, biology, and earth and environmental sciences and of interest to postgraduates who are not familiar with the application of multiavirate techniques and practising field biologists working in these areas.",zq9Lyqi3YL4C,,Cover image available via Google Books

Programming the Perl DBI,"Alligator Descartes,Tim Bunce",9781565926998,"""O'Reilly Media, Inc.""",2000,Computers,346,2.13,,"One of the greatest strengths of the Perl programming language is its ability to manipulate large amounts of data. Database programming is therefore a natural fit for Perl, not only for business applications but also for CGI-based web and intranet applications. The primary interface for database programming in Perl is DBI. DBI is a database-independent package that provides a consistent set of routines regardless of what database product you use--Oracle, Sybase, Ingres, Informix, you name it. The design of DBI is to separate the actual database drivers (DBDs) from the programmer's API, so any DBI program can work with any database, or even with multiple databases by different vendors simultaneously. Programming the Perl DBI is coauthored by Alligator Descartes, one of the most active members of the DBI community, and by Tim Bunce, the inventor of DBI. For the uninitiated, the book explains the architecture of DBI and shows you how to write DBI-based programs. For the experienced DBI dabbler, this book reveals DBI's nuances and the peculiarities of each individual DBD.

Protecting Networks with SATAN,Martin Freiss,9781565924253,O'Reilly,1998,Computers,112,2.10,,"SATAN (Security Administrator's Tool for Analyzing Networks) is a powerful aid for system administrators. It performs ""security audits,"" scanning host computers for security vulnerabilities caused by erroneous configurations or by known software errors in frequently used programs. SATAN is a particularly interesting piece of software because it uses the Web as its front end. Readers should be particularly interested in SATAN because it has earned a lot of publicity -- even notoriety. The original SATAN paper reported details, for the first time outside the hacker community, on how insecure some often-used services on the Internet really are. The SATAN software provided a tool for automatic detection of such vulnerabilities. Because SATAN could be run on other sites, not only your own, many critics predicted that SATAN would wreak destruction on the Internet. TheOakland Tribune, for example, wrote: ""It's like randomly mailing automatic rifles to 5000 addresses. I hope some crazy teen doesn't get a hold of one."" The dire results predicted have not come to pass, and SATAN has become a useful tool in many system administrators' toolboxes. This small book describes not only how to install and use SATAN, but also how to extend its modular structure to adapt it to local requirements and increase its knowledge of specific security vulnerabilities. This book also discusses how you can defend your site against potential abuse by SATAN. You can configure the program to detect when a potential intruder employs the program against your host and network, and you can take appropriate measures to repel the attacks.",MgNHAAAAYAAJ,,Cover image available via Google Books

In Protocol, Alexander Galloway argues that the founding principle of the Net is control, not freedom, and that the controlling power lies in the technical protocols that make network connections (and disconnections) possible. He does this by treating the computer as a textual medium that is based on a technological language, code. Code, he argues, can be subject to the same kind of cultural and literary analysis as any natural langua≥ computer languages have their own syntax, grammar, communities, and cultures. Instead of relying on established theoretical approaches, Galloway finds a new way to write about digital media, drawing on his backgrounds in computer programming and critical theory. ""Discipline-hopping is a necessity when it comes to complicated socio-technical topics like protocol,"" he writes in the preface.  Galloway begins by examining the types of protocols that exist, including TCP/IP, DNS, and HTML. He then looks at examples of resistance and subversion—hackers, viruses, cyberfeminism, Internet art—which he views as emblematic of the larger transformations now taking place within digital culture. Written for a nontechnical audience, Protocol serves as a necessary counterpoint to the wildly utopian visions of the Net that were so widespread in earlier days.",7ePFlE5oo7kC,,Cover image available via Google Books
PThreads Programming,"Dick Buttlar,Bradford Nichols,Jacqueline Farrell",9781449364755,"""O'Reilly Media, Inc.""",1996,Computers,286,2.12,,"Computers are just as busy as the rest of us nowadays. They have lots of tasks to do at once, and need some cleverness to get them all done at the same time.That's why threads are seen more and more often as a new model for programming. Threads have been available for some time. The Mach operating system, the Distributed Computer Environment (DCE), and Windows NT all feature threads.One advantage of most UNIX implementations, as well as DCE, is that they conform to a recently ratified POSIX standard (originally 1003.4a, now 1003.1c), which allows your programs to be portable between them. POSIX threads are commonly known as pthreads, after the word that starts all the names of the function calls. The standard is supported by Solaris, OSF/1, AIX, and several other UNIX-based operating systems.The idea behind threads programming is to have multiple tasks running concurrently within the same program. They can share a single CPU as processes do, or take advantage of multiple CPUs when available. In either case, they provide a clean way to divide the tasks of a program while sharing data.A window interface can read input on dozens of different buttons, each responsible for a separate task. A network server has to accept simultaneous calls from many clients, providing each with reasonable response time. A multiprocessor runs a number-crunching program on several CPUs at once, combining the results when all are done. All these kinds of applications can benefit from threads.In this book you will learn not only what the pthread calls are, but when it is a good idea to use threads and how to make them efficient (which is the whole reason for using threads in the first place). The authors delves into performance issues, comparing threads to processes, contrasting kernel threads to user threads, and showing how to measure speed. He also describes in a simple, clear manner what all the advanced features are for, and how threads interact with the rest of the UNIX system.Topics...",vjgEEAAAQBAJ,,Cover image available via Google Books

But Kuipers also presents the more conventional and familiar 3 x 3 (9-element) matrix rotation operator. These parallel presentations allow the reader to judge which approaches are preferable for specific applications. The volume is divided into three main parts. The opening chapters present introductory material and establish the book's terminology and notation. The next part presents the mathematical properties of quaternions, including quaternion algebra and geometry. It includes more advanced special topics in spherical trigonometry, along with an introduction to quaternion calculus and perturbation theory, required in many situations involving dynamics and kinematics. In the final section, Kuipers discusses state-of-the-art applications. He presents a six degree-of-freedom electromagnetic position and orientation transducer and concludes by discussing the computer graphics necessary for the development of applications in virtual reality.",_Og9DwAAQBAJ,,

RADIUS,Jonathan Hassell,9780596003227,"""O'Reilly Media, Inc.""",2003,Computers,190,2.1,,"The subject of security never strays far from the minds of IT workers, for good reason. If there is a network with even just one connection to another network, it needs to be secured. RADIUS, or Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service, is a widely deployed protocol that enables companies to authenticate, authorize and account for remote users who want access to a system or service from a central network server. Originally developed for dial-up remote access, RADIUS is now used by virtual private network (VPN) servers, wireless access points, authenticating Ethernet switches, Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) access, and other network access types. Extensible, easy to implement, supported, and actively developed, RADIUS is currently the de facto standard for remote authentication. RADIUS provides a complete, detailed guide to the underpinnings of the RADIUS protocol, with particular emphasis on the utility of user accounting. Author Jonathan Hassell draws from his extensive experience in Internet service provider operations to bring practical suggestions and advice for implementing RADIUS. He also provides instructions for using an open-source variation called FreeRADIUS. ""RADIUS is an extensible protocol that enjoys the support of a wide range of vendors,"" says Jonathan Hassell. ""Coupled with the amazing efforts of the open source development community to extend RADIUS's capabilities to other applications-Web, calling card security, physical device security, such as RSA's SecureID-RADIUS is possibly the best protocol with which to ensure only the people that need access to a resource indeed gain that access."" This unique book covers RADIUS completely, from the history and theory of the architecture around which it was designed, to how the protocol and its ancillaries function on a day-to-day basis, to implementing RADIUS-based security in a variety of corporate and service provider environments.

Recent Advances in Qualitative Physics,"Boi Faltings,Peter Struss",9780262061421,MIT Press,1992,Computers,453,2.7,,"These twenty-eight contributions report advances in one of the most active research areas in artificial intellgence. Qualitative modeling techniques are an essential part of building second generation knowledge-based systems. This book provides a timely overview of the field while also giving some indications about applications that appear to be feasible now or in the near future. Chapters are organized into sections covering modeling and simulation, ontologies, computational issues, and qualitative analysis. Modeling a physical system in order to simulate it or solve particular problems regarding the system is an important motivation of qualitative physics, involving formal procedures and concepts. The chapters in the section on modeling address the problem of how to set up and structure qualitative models, particularly for use in simulation. Ontology, or the science of being, is the basis for all modeling. Accordingly, chapters on ontologies discuss problems fundamental for finding representational formalism and inference mechanisms appropriate for different aspects of reasoning about physical systems. Computational issues arising from attempts to turn qualitative theories into practical software are then taken up. In addition to simulation and modeling, qualitative physics can be used to solve particular problems dealing with physical systems, and the concluding chapters present techniques for tasks ranging from the analysis of behavior to conceptual design.",xmoSnz47ouUC,,Cover image available via Google Books

Both apply methods that coordinate many processors to accomplish a single task. From mining genomes to the World Wide Web, from modeling financial markets to global weather patterns, parallel computing enables computations that would otherwise be impractical if not impossible with sequential approaches alone. Its fundamental role as an enabler of simulations and data analysis continues an advance in a wide range of application areas. Scientific Parallel Computing is the first textbook to integrate all the fundamentals of parallel computing in a single volume while also providing a basis for a deeper understanding of the subject. Designed for graduate and advanced undergraduate courses in the sciences and in engineering, computer science, and mathematics, it focuses on the three key areas of algorithms, architecture, languages, and their crucial synthesis in performance. The book's computational examples, whose math prerequisites are not beyond the level of advanced calculus, derive from a breadth of topics in scientific and engineering simulation and data analysis. The programming exercises presented early in the book are designed to bring students up to speed quickly, while the book later develops projects challenging enough to guide students toward research questions in the field. The new paradigm of cluster computing is fully addressed. A supporting web site provides access to all the codes and software mentioned in the book, and offers topical information on popular parallel computing systems. Integrates all the fundamentals of parallel computing essential for today's high-performance requirements  Ideal for graduate and advanced undergraduate students in the sciences and in engineering, computer science, and mathematics  Extensive programming and theoretical exercises enable students to write parallel codes quickly  More challenging p...",6OcSEAAAQBAJ,,Cover image available via Google Books

Now in its third edition, this best-selling reference will help you master the most demanding version of sendmail yet. The new edition of sendmail has been completely revised to cover sendmail 8.12--a version with more features and fundamental changes than any previous version of the Unix-based email routing program. Because the latest version of sendmail differs so significantly from earlier versions, a massive rewrite of this best-selling reference was called for.  The book begins by guiding you through the building and installation of sendmail and its companion programs, such as vacation and makemap. These additional programs are pivotal to sendmail's daily operation. Next, you'll cover the day-to-day administration of sendmail.

Palmer first encountered the elaborate mosaics of the Alhambra and became intrigued with learning to translate these patterns into folded paper. He turned for inspiration to the work of Japanese origami masters Tomoko Fuse, Jun Maekawa, Toshikazu Kawasaki and Shuzo Fujimoto, as well as to the great American origami artists Robert Lang and Peter Engel.The transition to working in cloth followed. The flexible property of cloth allows pleats to be folded to augment and give a dimensionality not present in a flat surface; and the translucent quality adds a unique intricacy to the geometric patterns. When lines in a pattern are folded as pleats, the resulting shapes formed by the pleats become part of the artistic expression of the material.The possibilities for using Shadowfolds in design are limitless. Some applications take advantage of light shining through the fabric, others show the richness of the folds that have a depth all their own. In addition to explaining the three very simple steps of the technique, the authors show how even novice folders can create breathtaking works of textile art, as well as fashion-forward clothes, accessories and home furnishings incorporating these three-dimensional embellishments. They also include a section of patterns, and fabric and craft resources.",fgSQEAAAQBAJ,,

Signals and Boundaries,John H. Holland,9780262525930,MIT Press,2014,Computers,316,2.1,,"An overarching framework for comparing and steering complex adaptive systems is developed through understanding the mechanisms that generate their intricate signal/boundary hierarchies.Complex adaptive systems (cas), including ecosystems, governments, biological cells, and markets, are characterized by intricate hierarchical arrangements of boundaries and signals. In ecosystems, for example, niches act as semi-permeable boundaries, and smells and visual patterns serve as signals; governments have departmental hierarchies with memoranda acting as signals; and so it is with other cas. Despite a wealth of data and descriptions concerning different cas, there remain many unanswered questions about ""steering"" these systems. In Signals and Boundaries, John Holland argues that understanding the origin of the intricate signal/border hierarchies of these systems is the key to answering such questions. He develops an overarching framework for comparing and steering cas through the mechanisms that generate their signal/boundary hierarchies.Holland lays out a path for developing the framework that emphasizes agents, niches, theory, and mathematical models. He discusses, among other topics, theory construction; signal-processing agents; networks as representations of signal/boundary interaction; adaptation; recombination and reproduction; the use of tagged urn models (adapted from elementary probability theory) to represent boundary hierarchies; finitely generated systems as a way to tie the models examined into a single framework; the framework itself, illustrated by a simple finitely generated version of the development of a multi-celled organism; and Markov processes.",hL34DwAAQBAJ,,Cover image available via Google Books

Freeman,1993,Observers' manuals,408,2.8,,"In the past twenty years, amateur astronomy has undergone a revolution as dramatic as the technological change that have affected professional research. Perhaps the 'amateur revolution' is the more remarkable of the two, because it seemed that the amateur was being squeezed out of thetraditional observational fields of work. Paradoxically, not only are the fields mostly still there, but new ones have opened up. The serious amateur today can make more discoveries and original observations than could his predecessor, and professional astronomers, recognising this potential, areaccording advanced amateurs respectable status. Sky Watcher's Handbook is for the amateur astronomer who, having passed through the first stage of getting acquainted with the sky, has decided to concentrate on a particular object or class of objects and make serious observations. The scope is vast- from meteors in the upper atmosphere to exploding stars in distant galaxies - and the front-line observational techniques have now become so specialized that it is no longer possible for a single author to write effectively about them all. Recognizing this, James Muirden has brought together fromaround the world a distinguished group of amateur astronomers, all leaders in their particular field. Each was asked to concentrate on the areas of work where the dedicated amateur can make a useful contribution; on the equipment and resources needed; and on the observational techniques to beemployed.

Soul Mountain,Gao Xingjian,9780066210827,HarperCollins,2000,Fiction,528,2.12,,"In 1983 Chinese playwright, critic, fiction writer, and painter Gao Xingjian (pronounced gow shing-jen) was diagnosed with lung cancer and faced imminent death.  But six weeks later, a second examination revealed there was no cancer -- he had won ""a reprieve from death"" and had been thrown back into the world of the living.  Faced with a repressive cultural environment and the threat of a spell in a prison farm, Gao fled Beijing.  He traveled to the remote mountains and ancient forests of Sichuan in southwest China and from there back to the east coast, a journey of fifteen thousand kilometers over a period of five months.  The results of this epic voyage of discovery is Soul Mountain.A bold, lyrical, prodigious novel, Soul Mountain probes the human soul with an uncommon directness and candor.  Interwoven with the myriad of stories and countless memorable characters -- from venerable Daosit masters and Buddhist nuns to mythical Wild Men, deadly Qichun snakes, and farting buses -- is the narrator's poignant inner journey and search for freedom. Fleeing the social conformity required by the Communist government, he wanders deep into the regions of the Qiang, Miago, and Yi peoples located on the fringes of Han Chinese civilization and discovers a plethora of different traditions, history, legends, folk songs, and landscapes. Slowly, with the help of memory, imagination, and sensory experience, he reconstructs his personal past. He laments the impact of the Cultural Revolution on the ecology -- both human and physical -- of China. And in a polyphony of narrating selves -- the narrator's ""I"" spawns a ""you,"" a ""she,"" and a ""he,"" each with a distinct perspective and voice -- the novel delights in the freedom of the imagination to expand the notion of the individual self.Storytelling saves the narrator from a deep loneliness that is part of the human condition.

But for organizations, the cost of spam in lost productivity and burned bandwidth is astronomical. While society is grappling with a solution to the burgeoning crisis of spam proliferation, the pressure is on system administrators to find a solution to this massive problem in-house. And fast.  Sys admins can field scores of complaints and spend months testing software suites that turn out to be too aggressive, too passive, or too complicated to setup only to discover that SpamAssassin (SA), the leading open source spam-fighting tool, is free, flexible, powerful, highly-regarded, and remarkably effective.

Kline,Daniel Kline",9781565927445,O'Reilly & Associates,2001,Computers,214,2.13,,"SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized query language for requesting information from a database. Historically, SQL has been the choice for database management systems running on minicomputers and mainframes. Increasingly, however, SQL is being adapted to PC database systems because it supports distributed databases--databases that are spread out over several computer systems, so that several users on a local-area network can access the same database simultaneously. Although there are different dialects of SQL, it is the closest thing to a standard query language that currently exists. SQL in a Nutshellis a practical and useful command reference to the latest release of the Structured Query Language (SQL99), helping readers learn how their favorite database product supports any standard SQL command. This book presents each of the SQL commands and describes its use in both commercial (Microsoft SQL Server 2000 and Oracle 8i) and open source (MySQL, PostgreSQL 7.0) implementations. Each command reference includes the command syntax (by vendor, if the syntax differs across implementations), a description, and informative examples that illustrate important concepts and uses. SQL in a Nutshell is more than a convenient reference guide for experienced SQL programmers, analysts, and database administrators. It's also a great learning resource for novice and auxiliary SQL users such as system administrators, users of packaged client/server products, and consultants who need to be familiar with the various SQL dialects across many platforms.",381Y_TuuSvwC,,Cover image available via Google Books

In the book that People magazine proclaimed “beguiling” and “fascinating,” Robert Greene and Joost Elffers have distilled three thousand years of the history of power into 48 essential laws by drawing from the philosophies of Machiavelli, Sun Tzu, and Carl Von Clausewitz and also from the lives of figures ranging from Henry Kissinger to P.T. Barnum.   Some laws teach the need for prudence (“Law 1: Never Outshine the Master”), others teach the value of confidence (“Law 28: Enter Action with Boldness”), and many recommend absolute self-preservation (“Law 15: Crush Your Enemy Totally”). Every law, though, has one thing in common: an interest in total domination. In a bold and arresting two-color package, The 48 Laws of Power is ideal whether your aim is conquest, self-defense, or simply to understand the rules of the game.",HIZPEAAAQBAJ,,Cover image available via Google Books

The Architecture of Error,Francesca Hughes,9780262526364,MIT Press,2014,Architecture,328,2.10,,"Why the rise of redundant precision in architecture and the accompanying fear of error are key to understanding the discipline's needs, anxieties and desires.When architects draw even brick walls to six decimal places with software designed to cut lenses, it is clear that the logic that once organized relations between precision and material error in construction has unraveled. Precision, already a promiscuous term, seems now to have been uncoupled from its contract with truthfulness. Meanwhile error, and the always-political space of its dissent, has reconfigured itself.In The Architecture of Error Francesca Hughes argues that behind the architect's acute fetishization of redundant precision lies a special fear of physical error. What if we were to consider the pivotal cultural and technological transformations of modernism to have been driven not so much by the causes its narratives declare, she asks, as by an unspoken horror of loss of control over error, material life, and everything that matter stands for? Hughes traces the rising intolerance of material vagaries—from the removal of ornament to digitalized fabrication—that produced the blind rejection of organic materials, the proliferation of material testing, and the rhetorical obstacles that blighted cybernetics. Why is it, she asks, that the more we cornered physical error, the more we feared it?Hughes's analysis of redundant precision exposes an architecture of fear whose politics must be called into question. Proposing error as a new category for architectural thought, Hughes draws on other disciplines and practices that have interrogated precision and failure, citing the work of scientists Nancy Cartwright and Evelyn Fox Keller and visual artists Gordon Matta-Clark, Barbara Hepworth, Rachel Whiteread, and others. These non-architect practitioners, she argues, show that error need not be excluded and precision can be made accountable.",gYmNBQAAQBAJ,,Cover image available via Google Books
The Architecture of H.H. Richardson and His Times,Henry-Russell Hitchcock,9780262580052,MIT Press,1966,Architecture,343,2.5,,"H. H. Richardson was born into the architectural chaos of the mid-eighteen hundreds and dies in the architectural revolution of the age of the skyscraper, yet his genius and reputation were able to surmount the first and survive the latter. This is a study of his architecture and of the setting in which he worked. It includes detailed discussions of the social,, economic, and technical history of the era and examines the architecture of Richardson's contemporaries and of those countries in which he traveled and lived. His heritage was the romantic generation that had contemptuously renounced the austerity of the classical revival and, in the search for stylistic stimulation, had borrowed indiscriminately from the rich bazaar of historic and exotic styles, the Gothic, Italianate, Norman, Byzantine. By the time Richardson had completed his education at Harvard and at the École des Beaux-Arts, this mixed architectural diet had played havoc with the American taste. In his maturity he developed a personal style that resolved the dilemma in which he found himself: his own good taste and judgment demanded utility, spatial tangibility, function; his public demanded pictorial surface effects. His reconciliation of these disparities resulted in his finest works: Trinity Church, Boston; the Marshall Field Wholesale Store, Chicago; the Allegheny County Courthouse and Jail, Pittsburgh; Sever Hall, Cambridge. At the time of his death technological advances had made the skyscraper feasible, and in the succeeding years architectural form was virtually dictated by these advances. Richardson's mastery of traditional composition, mortar, polychromy, and ornament was largely forgotten. Today in the search for aesthetic expression of fine materials and (integral) ornament, Richardson's work is relevant once more for practical as well as historical purposes.",1DKexwEACAAJ,,Cover image available via Google Books

First presented in Paris in 1904 by the Lumiere brothers, autochrome has a nuance and fragility that seems to impose its own aesthetic on practitioners. In one example of the 75 included, Karl Struss's 1910 work, Boardwalk, L.I. , has a charm that eludes today's more glaring standards, in part, perhaps, because the muted softness inherent in the process mitigates the bright sunlight indicated by the numerous raised parasols. Wood's smart text also explains how the Photo-Secessionists, in their artistic and literary ferment, later rejected autochrome.

The Book of Mormon,Joseph Smith,N/A,DigiCat,2022,Religion,501,2.10,,"The Book of Mormon is a profound religious text that serves as a cornerstone of the Latter-day Saint movement. Written in a unique scriptural style, similar to the King James Bible, it chronicles the spiritual and temporal journeys of ancient American civilizations. The narrative is structured in a historical format, spanning centuries and weaving complex themes of faith, prophecy, and redemption. The book asserts the visitation of Jesus Christ to the Americas, emphasizing the universality of His teachings, while also offering insights into the moral dilemmas faced by its diverse characters, illuminating questions of divine grace and human agency. Joseph Smith, the book's translator and the founder of the LDS Church, was a 19th-century religious leader driven by visions and prophetic revelations. His own experiences with religious fervor and dissatisfaction propelled him to seek new spiritual truths, leading to the translation of the gold plates he claimed to have discovered. This personal quest, rooted in the religious revivalist climate of early America, shaped Smith's visionary work, aiming to present a narrative that resonates with both ancient and contemporary audiences, challenging existing theological paradigms. The Book of Mormon invites readers into a transformative spiritual journey, urging them to explore their personal beliefs within a broader religious context. Its rich narrative and doctrinal depth offer profound insights for those seeking not only historical understanding but also spiritual awakening.

The Case for Greatness,Robert Faulkner,9780300150278,Yale University Press,2008,Political Science,288,2.6,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51J024s98DL._AC_UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg","A searching defense of great political leadership​The Case for Greatness is a spirited look at political ambition, good and bad, with particular attention to honorable ambition. Robert Faulkner contends that too many modern accounts of leadership slight such things as determination to excel, good judgment, justice, and a sense of honor—the very qualities that distinguish the truly great. And here he offers an attempt to recover “a reasonable understanding of excellence,” that which distinguishes a Franklin D. Roosevelt and a Lincoln from lesser leaders. Faulkner finds the most telling diagnoses in antiquity and examines closely Aristotle’s great-souled man, two accounts of the spectacular and dubious Athenian politician Alcibiades, and the life of the imperial conqueror Cyrus the Great. There results a complex and compelling picture of greatness and its problems. Faulkner dissects military and imperial ambition, the art of leadership, and, in the later example of George Washington, ambition in the service of popular self-government. He also addresses modern indictments of even the best forms of political greatness, whether in the critical thinking of Hobbes, the idealism of Kant, the relativism and brutalism of Nietzsche, or the egalitarianism of Rawls and Arendt. He shows how modern philosophy came to doubt and indeed disdain even the best forms of ambition. This book is a nuanced defense of admirable ambition and the honor-seeking life, as well as an irresistible invitation to apply these terms to our own times and leaders.",yyPe8uYcsrYC,,

Narrated by a fifteen-year-old autistic savant obsessed with Sherlock Holmes, this dazzling novel weaves together an old-fashioned mystery, a contemporary coming-of-age story, and a fascinating excursion into a mind incapable of processing emotions. Christopher John Francis Boone knows all the countries of the world and their capitals and every prime number up to 7,057. Although gifted with a superbly logical brain, Christopher is autistic. Everyday interactions and admonishments have little meaning for him. At fifteen, Christopher's carefully constructed world falls apart when he finds his neighbour's dog Wellington impaled on a garden fork, and he is initially blamed for the killing. Christopher decides that he will track down the real killer, and turns to his favourite fictional character, the impeccably logical Sherlock Holmes, for inspiration. But the investigation leads him down some unexpected paths and ultimately brings him face to face with the dissolution of his parents' marriage. As Christopher tries to deal with the crisis within his own family, the narrative draws readers into the workings of Christopher's mind. And herein lies the key to the brilliance of Mark Haddon's choice of narrator: The most wrenching of emotional moments are chronicled by a boy who cannot fathom emotions.The effect is dazzling, making for one of the freshest debut in years: a comedy, a tearjerker, a mystery story, a novel of exceptional literary merit that is great fun to read.

It shows that a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) can offer excellent performance for a system with dynamic data typing, and that automatic storage reclamation need not be time-consuming. The Smalltalk-80 system makes it possible to write programs quickly by providing object-oriented programming, incremental compilation, run-time type checking, use-extensible data types and control structures, and an interactive graphical interface. However, the potential savings in programming effort have been curtailed by poor performance in widely-available computers or by high processor cost. To solve these problems, a group of researchers has designed and built the SOAR (Smalltalk on a RISC) microprocessor which is documented in this book. Their findings suggest that: the language-specific hardware in SOAR doubles its performance over a RISC II with the same cycle time; generation scavenging, a storage reclamation algorithm developed by the author, consumes only 3 percent of the CPU time, in contrast to the 9 percent of comparable Smalltalk-80 systems; and that the SOAR microprocessor should run as fast as an ECL Dorado minicomputer, despite a five-to-one handicap in basic cycle time. They also identify six features that substantially improve performance, as well as seven that contribute little to performance. Contents:Introduction. Previous Work. The SOAR Architecture.

Feynman was targeting the lectures to students who, ""at the end of two years of our previous course, [were] very discouraged because there were really very few grand, new, modern ideas presented to them.""

The Handbook of Japanese Adjectives and Adverbs,Taeko Kamiya,9781568364162,Kodansha USA,2012,Foreign Language Study,336,2.10,,"For any beginner of Japanese, adjectives and adverbs are bound to present a challenge. Unlike English adjectives, Japanese ones conjugate, meaning that you must memorize their various forms before being able to build sentences of any complexity. Adverbs do not conjugate, but make use of particles to show their grammatical relationship to other words, and some have very subtle shades of meaning that are difficult to grasp. Moreover, many do not translate into adverbs in English.The role these parts of speech play in adding flavor to the Japanese language is invaluable. This handy reference manual introduces the basic (and basics of) adjectives and adverbs in a clear and sensible way, enabling students not only to speak Japanese but to do it with pizzazz.The book is divided roughly in half, the first half dealing with adjectives, the second with adverbs. Each is prefaced by a short introduction that serves as an overview of the material introduced. The section on adjectives is divided into two parts: Part 1 covers the conjugations of i- and na-adjectives and some basic auxiliary adjectives, and Part 2 presents common sentence patterns in which adjectives appear.The adverb section is arranged by topic. Among the types of adverbs explained here are those used to express time, quantity, degree, circumstance, and natural sounds or actions (the ubiquitous onomatopoeic adverbs).Each entry in this book is given a simple, concise English explanation and two or more example sentences to illustrate its usage. Exercises every few pages enable students to measure their understanding. Finally, a number of quick-reference lists in the appendixes provide a convenient means of recalling and building vocabulary.Together with its sister publication, The Handbook of Japanese Verbs, this unique manual is certain to provide years of friendly guidance.",5gSQEAAAQBAJ,,Cover image available via Google Books

Each form is followed by a short exercise, reinforcing the points just made.Part 2 takes up the forms described in the first part and shows how they function in full-fledged sentences. Each discussion is followed by examples and exercises, ensuring that the student has understood the forms under discussion.In the appendices, the student is offered a number of look-up methods, including an English-Japanese verb dictionary.

The Little Schemer introduces computing as an extension of arithmetic and algebra; things that everyone studies in grade school and high school. It introduces programs as recursive functions and briefly discusses the limits of what computers can do. The authors use the programming language Scheme, and interesting foods to illustrate these abstract ideas. The Seasoned Schemer informs the reader about additional dimensions of computing: functions as values, change of state, and exceptional cases. The Little LISPer has been a popular introduction to LISP for many years. It had appeared in French and Japanese. The Little Schemer and The Seasoned Schemer are worthy successors and will prove equally popular as textbooks for Scheme courses as well as companion texts for any complete introductory course in Computer Science.",xyO-KLexVnMC,,Duplicate ISBN - verify edition; Possible duplicate entry; Cover image available via Google Books

The Making of Second Life,Wagner James Au,9780061747243,Harper Collins,2009,Business & Economics,304,2.12,,"The wholly virtual world known as Second Life has attracted more than a million active users, millions of dollars, and created its own—very real—economy.The Making of Second Life is the behind-the-scenes story of the Web 2.0 revolution's most improbable enterprise: the creation of a virtual 3-D world with its own industries, culture, and social systems. Now the toast of the Internet economy, and the subject of countless news articles, profiles, and television shows, Second Life is usually known for the wealth of real-world companies (Reuters, Pontiac, IBM) that have created ""virtual offices"" within it, and the number of users (""avatars"") who have become wealthy through their user-created content.What sets Second Life apart from other online worlds, and what has made it such a success (one million-plus monthly users and growing) is its simple user-centered philosophy. Instead of attempting to control the activities of those who enter it, the creators of Second Life turned them loose: users (also known as Residents) own the rights to the intellectual content they create in-world, and the in-world currency of Linden Dollars is freely exchangeable for U.S. currency. Residents have responded by generating millions of dollars of economic activity through their in-world designs and purchases—currently, the Second Life economy averages more than one million U.S. dollars in transactions every day, while dozens of real-world companies and projects have evolved and developed around content originated in Second Life. Wagner James Au explores the long, implausible road behind that success, and looks at the road ahead, where many believe that user-created worlds like Second Life will become the Net's next generation and the fulcrum for a revolution in the way we shop, work, and interact. Au's story is narrated from both within the corporate offices of Linden Lab, Second Life's creator, and from within Second Life itself, revealing all the fascinating, outrageous, brilliant, an...",6Y1i0IDHDYwC,,Cover image available via Google Books

The Nature of Consciousness,Rupert Spira,9781684030026,New Harbinger  Publications,2017,Self-Help,296,2.12,,"“I’ve gained deeper understanding listening to Rupert Spira than I have from any other exponent of modern spirituality. Reality is sending us a message we desperately need to hear, and at this moment no messenger surpasses Spira and the transformative words in his essays.” —Deepak Chopra, author of You Are the Universe, Spiritual Solutions, and Super Brain Our world culture is founded on the assumption that the Big Bang gave rise to matter, which in time evolved into the world, into which the body was born, inside which a brain appeared, out of which consciousness at some late stage developed. As a result of this “matter model,” most of us believe that consciousness is a property of the body. We feel that it is “I,” this body, that knows or is aware of the world. We believe and feel that the knowing with which we are aware of our experience is located in and shares the limits and destiny of the body. This is the fundamental presumption of mind and matter that underpins almost all our thoughts and feelings and is expressed in our activities and relationships. The Nature of Consciousness suggests that the matter model has outlived its function and is now destroying the very values it once sought to promote.For many people, the debate as to the ultimate reality of the universe is an academic one, far removed from the concerns and demands of everyday life. After all, life happens independently of our models of it. However, The Nature of Consciousness will clearly show that the materialist paradigm is a philosophy of despair and, as such, the root cause of unhappiness in individuals. It is a philosophy of conflict and, as such, the root cause of hostilities between families, communities, and nations. Far from being abstract and philosophical, its implications touch each one of us directly and intimately.An exploration of the nature of consciousness has the power to reveal the peace and happiness that truly lie at the heart of experience.

The Perfect Swarm,Len Fisher,9780465018840,Basic Books,2009,FAMILY & RELATIONSHIPS,260,2.1,,"One of the greatest discoveries of recent times is that the complex patterns we find in life are often produced when all of the individuals in a group follow the same simple rule. This process of ""self-organization” reveals itself in the inanimate worlds of crystals and seashells, but as Len Fisher shows, it is also evident in living organisms, from fish to ants to human beings. The coordinated movements of fish in shoals, for example, arise from the simple rule: ""Follow the fish in front.” Traffic flow arises from simple rules: ""Keep your distance” and ""Keep to the right.” Now, in his new book, Fisher shows how we can manage our complex social lives in an ever more chaotic world. His investigation encompasses topics ranging from ""swarm intelligence” to the science of parties and the best ways to start a fad. Finally, Fisher sheds light on the beauty and utility of complexity theory.

Featuring iconic and impossible stories from ""the playa,"" interviews with Burning Man's founders and staff, and personal recollections of the late Larry Harvey--Burning Man's founder, ""Chief Philosophical Officer,"" and the author's close friend and colleague--The Scene That Became Cities introduces readers to the experience of Burning Man; explains why it grew; posits how it could impact fields as diverse as art, economics, and politics; and makes the ideas behind it accessible, actionable, and useful.",FuecDwAAQBAJ,,Cover image available via Google Books
The Science of Weird Shit,Chris French,9780262048361,MIT Press,2024,Psychology,416,2.12,,"An accessible and gratifying introduction to the world of paranormal beliefs and bizarre experiences.Ghostly encounters, alien abduction, reincarnation, talking to the dead, UFO sightings, inexplicable coincidences, out-of-body and near-death experiences. Are these legitimate phenomena? If not, then how should we go about understanding them? In this fascinating book, Chris French investigates paranormal claims to discover what lurks behind this “weird shit.” French provides authoritative evidence-based explanations for a wide range of superficially mysterious phenomena, and then goes further to draw out lessons with wider applications to many other aspects of modern society where critical thinking is urgently needed.Using academic, comprehensive, logical, and, at times, mathematical approaches, The Science of Weird Shit convincingly debunks ESP, communicating with the dead, and alien abduction claims, among other phenomena. All the while, however, French maintains that our belief in such phenomena is neither ridiculous nor trivial; if anything, such claims can tell us a great deal about the human mind if we pay them the attention they are due. Filled with light-bulb moments and a healthy dose of levity, The Science of Weird Shit is a clever, memorable, and gratifying read you won’t soon forget.",RmW9EAAAQBAJ,,Cover image available via Google Books

Knuth's preparation for Volume Four of The Art of Computer Programming. The book's first goal is to use examples to demonstrate the art of literate programming. Each example provides a programmatic essay that can be read and enjoyed as readily as it can be interpreted by machines. In these essays/programs, Knuth makes new contributions to several important algorithms and data structures, so the programs are of special interest for their content as well as for their style.The book's second goal is to provide a useful means for comparing combinatorial algorithms and for evaluating methods of combinatorial computing. To this end, Knuth's programs offer standard, freely available sets of data - the Stanford GraphBase - that may be used as benchmarks to test competing methods. The data sets are both interesting in themselves and applicable to a wide variety of problem domains. With objective tests, Knuth hopes to bridge the gap between theoretical computer scientists and programmers who have real problems to solve.As with all of Knuth's writings, this book is appreciated not only for the author's unmatched insight, but also for the fun and the challenge of his work. He illustrates many of the most significant and most beautiful combinatorial algorithms that are presently known and provides sample programs that can lead to hours of amusement. In showing how the Stanford GraphBase can generate an almost inexhaustible supply of challenging problems, some of which may lead to the discovery of new and improved algorithms, Knuth proposes friendly competitions. His own initial entries into such competitions are included in the book, and readers are challenged to do better.Features Includes new contributions to our understanding of important algorithms and data structures Provides a standard tool for evaluating combinatorial algorithms Demonstrates a more readable, more pr...",0-5QAAAAMAAJ,,

The Storytelling Animal,Jonathan Gottschall,9780547391403,Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,2012,Literary Criticism,248,2.12,,"Humans live in landscapes of make-believe. We spin fantasies. We devour novels, films, and plays. Even sporting events and criminal trials unfold as narratives. Yet the world of story has long remained an undiscovered and unmapped country. It's easy to say that humans are ""wired"" for story, but ""why""? In this delightful and original book, Jonathan Gottschall offers the first unified theory of storytelling. He argues that stories help us navigate life's complex social problems--just as flight simulators prepare pilots for difficult situations. Storytelling has evolved, like other behaviors, to ensure our survival. Drawing on the latest research in neuroscience, psychology, and evolutionary biology, Gottschall tells us what it means to be a storytelling animal. Did you know that the more absorbed you are in a story, the more it changes your behavior? That all children act out the same kinds of stories, whether they grow up in a slum or a suburb? That people who read more fiction are more empathetic? Of course, our story instinct has a darker side. It makes us vulnerable to conspiracy theories, advertisements, and narratives about ourselves that are more ""truthy"" than true. National myths can also be terribly dangerous: Hitler's ambitions were partly fueled by a story. But as Gottschall shows in this remarkable book, stories can also change the world for the better. Most successful stories are moral--they teach us how to live, whether explicitly or implicitly, and bind us together around common values. We know we are master shapers of story. ""The Storytelling Animal"" finally reveals how stories shape ""us.""",Gd3lT5yP3ZQC,,Cover image available via Google Books

As the author remarks, there is a tremendous treasure of philosophical meaning"" behind the great theories of Euler and Lagrange, Hamilton, Jacobi, and other mathematical thinkers.

Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them, and won by them.One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece, Jasnah.

As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.The result of over ten years of planning, writing, and world-building, The Way of Kings is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.Speak again the ancient oaths:Life befor...",QVn-CgAAQBAJ,,Cover image available via Google Books

How do you know if tinkering kids are learning anything or not? Is there a line between fooling around with real stuff and learning? The idea of learning through tinkering is not so radical. From the dawn of time, whenever humanity has wanted to know more, we have achieved it most effectively by getting our hands dirty and making careful observations of real stuff.  Make: Tinkering (Kids Learn by Making Stuff) lets you discover how, why--and even what it is--to tinker and tinker well.

Visit ucpress.edu/go/americanstudiesnow to learn more. In the last decade, public discussions of transgender issues have increased exponentially. However, with this increased visibility has come not just power, but regulation, both in favor of and against trans people. What was once regarded as an unusual or even unfortunate disorder has become an accepted articulation of gendered embodiment as well as a new site for political activism and political recognition. What happened in the last few decades to prompt such an extensive rethinking of our understanding of gendered embodiment? How did a stigmatized identity become so central to U.S. and European articulations of self? And how have people responded to the new definitions and understanding of sex and the gendered body?

The codes unleashed within this embryonic, 5-kilobyte universe—less memory than is allocated to displaying a single icon on a computer screen today—broke the distinction between numbers that mean things and numbers that do things, and our universe would never be the same.

The kernel is Linux--in the case of the Linux operating system, it's the only bit of software to which the term ""Linux"" applies. The kernel handles all the requests or completed I/O operations and determines which programs will share its processing time, and in what order. Responsible for the sophisticated memory management of the whole system, the Linux kernel is the force behind the legendary Linux efficiency. The new edition of Understanding the Linux Kernel takes you on a guided tour through the most significant data structures, many algorithms, and programming tricks used in the kernel. Probing beyond the superficial features, the authors offer valuable insights to people who want to know how things really work inside their machine. Relevant segments of code are dissected and discussed line by line. The book covers more than just the functioning of the code, it explains the theoretical underpinnings for why Linux does things the way it does. The new edition of the book has been updated to cover version 2.4 of the kernel, which is quite different from version 2.2: the virtual memory system is entirely new, support for multiprocessor systems is improved, and whole new classes of hardware devices have been added.

Use Case Modeling,"Kurt Bittner,Ian Spence",9780201709131,Addison-Wesley Professional,2003,Business & Economics,347,2.9,,"Use cases are a simple, straightforward -- yet very powerful -- way to express the functional requirements (or behaviors) of a system. Use cases have gained widespread acceptance because they make requirements less ambiguous by specifying exactly when and under what conditions certain behaviors occur. As a result, those who effective employ use cases to model their systems can better deliver projects on time, within budget, and with fewer defects. However, use case modeling is not that easy; it is a practice that comes with characteristics that can impact a project. In this new book, the authors allow you to benefit from their considerable experience making use cases work well in a number of different environments. With the advice, tips, and tricks presented herein, the reader will be further along the path to understanding and exploiting the power of use cases, and ultimately constructing better applications. In writing this book, the authors have worked closely with use case founder Ivar Jacobson, and the book is unique in that it presents a Rational Software Corporation-centric examination of this topic.",zvxfXvEcQjUC,,Cover image available via Google Books

Using and Managing PPP,Andrew Sun,9781565923218,"""O'Reilly Media, Inc.""",1999,Computers,430,2.12,,"In the last decade, the Internet has grown from a network that connected a few universities and research centers to a network that links many businesses and households all over the country. That expansion occurred for many reasons, but the technological advance that facilitated this growth was an obscure protocol called PPP. PPP isn't talked about as much as TCP and IP, but it plays a crucial role in extending networks into remote locations. The Point-to-Point Protocol enables telephone lines and other point-to-point connections to carry Internet traffic. It's the protocol that establishes and maintains the connection between your home and an Internet service provider. This book provides in-depth coverage of PPP for network administrators and others who are involved in the care and maintenance of PPP connections. It provides a thorough introduction to how PPP works, which will help you diagnose and troubleshoot problems. It discusses in detail how to set up dial-in and dial-out PPP on the most important platforms, including Windows, Linux, and Solaris. Whether you're a sophisticated user responsible for your own connection or a network administrator providing dial-up services for hundreds of remote users, you'll find this book an essential addition to your library. Covers: PPP implementations in Windows 95/98/NT, Solaris, and Linux Authentication (CHAP, PAP, Microsoft variants, and other techniques) Virtual networks and tunnels, including PPTP Modems and serial lines Related technologies, including DNS and ARP Optimizing and customizing a connection Debugging techniques",oGn6mqsYHIIC,,Cover image available via Google Books
Using Samba,"Robert Eckstein,David Collier-Brown,Peter Kelly",9781565924499,O'Reilly,2000,Computers,398,2.13,,"This book, which has been officially adopted by the Samba team under an open content license, is a comprehensive guide to Samba administration, including such recent additions as integration with Windows NT domains and the SWAT graphic configuration tool. Samba is a cross-platform triumph: it turns a Unix or Linux system into a file and print server for Microsoft Windows network clients. Now you can let users store their files (and even important executables) in a single place for easy sharing and backup, protected by Unix or NT security mechanisms, and still offer such transparent access that PC users don't even realize they're going to another system. The magic behind Samba is that it recognizes and speaks the SMB protocol developed by Microsoft for file and printer sharing on its own systems. Basic Samba configuration is simple, but you'll want to make sure your security settings are just right and find out about the full range of options (how do you like your filenames mangled?). Trouble-shooting, security, connectivity, performance, and logging are thoroughly covered with examples in this book. Samba is so robust, flexible, and secure that many people are choosing it over Windows NT for their file and print services. Furthermore, Samba is proving to be a necessity for the many organizations that have an existing Unix or Linux system and want to tie in PCs running Microsoft software. Samba is also open source software, licensed under the GNU General Public License. The authors present the most common configurations and problems in an easy-to-follow manner, along with instructions for getting the most out of Samba. Whether you're playing on one note or a full three-octave range, this book will give you an efficient and secure server. The included CD-ROM holds sources and ready-to-install binaries, plus other useful information.",991FAQAAIAAJ,,Cover image available via Google Books

Web Client Programming with Perl,Clinton Wong,9781565922143,O'Reilly,1997,Computers,213,2.12,,"On the World Wide Web, people are accustomed to using graphical browsers such as Netscape Navigator or Mosaic as their only interface for visiting remote sites, accessing up-to-date documents, and filling out forms. But graphical browsers can be limiting: the very interactivity that makes them so intuitive to use also makes them clumsy for automating tasks. If you want to get the latest weather report every few hours, track a Federal Express package online, or use a dictionary server repeatedly throughout the day, using your browser to perform the same task over and over can become cumbersome. As with any repetitive task, these applications are best done by writing a script. Web Client Programming with Perlshows you how to extend scripting skills to the Web. This book teaches you the basics of how browsers communicate with servers and how to write your own customized Web clients to automate common tasks. It is intended for those who are motivated to develop software that offers a more flexible and dynamic response than a standard Web browser. Using this book, you'll learn how to:  Automate repetitive queries on the Web Detect broken hyperlinks on your site Write simple ""robots"" that traverse hyperlinks across a site, and across the Web in general  This book will be of interest to:  Web administrators who need to automate repetitive tasks or reduce maintenance time UNIX shell programmers who want to interface their scripts to the Web Commercial software developers and consultants who need reference material for technical Web specifications and proof-of-concept examples  Most of the examples in this book use Perl, a versatile and portable language that is already familiar to many CGI programmers and UNIX power users. The book does not teach Perl, but the techniques used in the book should be easily followed by anyone with some programming background and can be adapted to whatever language you choose.",u8DBnWT68p4C,,Cover image available via Google Books

Writing GNU Emacs Extensions,Bob Glickstein,9781565922617,"""O'Reilly Media, Inc.""",1997,Computers,215,2.13,,"Yes, it is possible to be all things to all people, if you're talking about the Emacs editor. As a user, you can make any kind of customization you want, from choosing the keystrokes that invoke your favorite commands to creating a whole new work environment that looks like nothing ever developed before. It's all in Emacs Lisp -- and in this short but fast-paced book. GNU Emacs is more than an editor; it's a programming environment, a communications package, and many other things. To provide such a broad range of functions, it offers a full version of the Lisp programming language -- something much more powerful than the little macro languages provided in other editors (including older versions of Emacs). GNU Emacs is a framework in which you can create whole new kinds of editors or just alter aspects of the many functions it already provides. In this book, Bob Glickstein delves deep into the features that permit far-reaching Emacs customizations. He teaches you the Lisp language and discusses Emacs topics (such as syntax tables and macro templates) in easy-to-digest portions. Examples progress in complexity from simple customizations to extensive major modes. You will learn how to write interactive commands, use hooks and advice, perform error recovery, manipulate windows, buffers, and keymaps, exploit and alter Emacs's main loop, and more. Each topic is explored through realistic examples and a series of successive refinements that illustrate not only the Emacs Lisp language, but the development process as well, making learning pleasant and natural.",FjzWEfXNMfwC,,Cover image available via Google Books
